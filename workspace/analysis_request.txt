GRAPH ANALYZER REQUEST

Task: Analyze complex video workflow for WAN2.1 reorganization
File: workspace/output/workflows/CURRENT/seamless_loop_original.json
Nodes: 81 total nodes
Workflow Type: Video generation with seamless loop functionality

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. Identify all node types and their semantic categories
2. Map connection patterns for MODEL, CLIP, VAE data flow
3. Identify video processing pipeline nodes
4. Group nodes into 6 semantic categories:
   - Model Loading (UnetLoader, VAELoader, CLIPLoader)
   - LoRA Stack (LoraLoaderModelOnly nodes)
   - Prompt Processing (CLIPTextEncode)
   - Generation Control (Samplers, schedulers, CFG)
   - Video Processing (WanVideo*, VHS_VideoCombine)
   - Output (Save/Preview)

5. Identify optimization opportunities for professional layout
6. Map execution flow and dependencies

CONTEXT: This analysis will feed into Layout-Strategist for 1500-2000px spacing design
