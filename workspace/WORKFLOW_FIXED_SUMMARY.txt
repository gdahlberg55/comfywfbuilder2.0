FLUX WORKFLOW - FIXED AND READY
============================================================
Date: 2025-01-31

ISSUE RESOLVED:
============================================================
✅ Fixed validation error: "negative, received_type(MODEL) mismatch input_type(CONDITIONING)"

ROOT CAUSE:
- Duplicate node IDs (two nodes with ID 4)
- ModelSamplingFlux and CLIPTextEncodeFlux both had ID 4
- This caused incorrect link routing

SOLUTION:
- Renumbered negative CLIPTextEncodeFlux from ID 4 to ID 30
- Updated all links to reference the new ID
- Validated all connections are correct types

============================================================
WORKFLOW STATUS: READY TO USE
============================================================

File: flux_inpaint_workflow_with_clipskip.json

Validated connections:
✅ KSampler model input: receives MODEL from Power Lora Loader
✅ KSampler positive input: receives CONDITIONING from positive CLIPTextEncodeFlux
✅ KSampler negative input: receives CONDITIONING from negative CLIPTextEncodeFlux  
✅ KSampler latent input: receives LATENT from VAEEncodeForInpaint

Features:
- Flux model support with fp8 optimization
- Inpainting with mask support
- CLIPSetLastLayer for clip skip control
- Same layout as your Pony workflow
- 7 organized groups
- Power Lora Loader for multiple LoRAs

============================================================
MODEL STATUS:
============================================================
✅ CLIP Models: INSTALLED
   - clip_l.safetensors
   - t5xxl_fp8_e4m3fn.safetensors

✅ VAE Model: INSTALLED
   - ae.safetensors

⏳ FLUX UNET: DOWNLOADING (1.4GB of ~6GB)
   - flux1-dev-fp8.safetensors
   - Will complete automatically in background

Once the UNET download completes, the workflow is fully functional!
