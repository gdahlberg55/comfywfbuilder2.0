# Agent Self-Audit Delegation Plan

## The Problem
I (Orchestrator) have been trying to audit all agents myself, which is:
1. Inefficient - serial processing instead of parallel
2. Biased - I can't objectively audit myself or my decisions
3. Incomplete - I lack deep knowledge of each agent's internals
4. Against the system design - agents should be autonomous

## The Solution: Proper Delegation

### Phase 1: Self-Audits (Parallel Execution)
Each agent should audit THEMSELVES based on today's session data:

```
Memory-Monitor -> Analyze why you weren't invoked for 86-node workflow
Visualizer -> Explain why no screenshots were requested
Parameter-Extractor -> Why didn't you extract spacing preferences
Asset-Finder -> Were you even used today?
Node-Curator -> Did you verify node schemas with MCP?
```

### Phase 2: Peer Reviews (Cross-Validation)
Agents review each other's audits:
- Layout-Strategist reviews Layout-Refiner
- Reroute-Engineer reviews Graph-Analyzer
- Workflow-Validator reviews Workflow-Serializer
- Group-Coordinator reviews Nomenclature-Specialist

### Phase 3: Learning Integration
Learning-Agent synthesizes all audits and creates:
1. System-wide failure patterns
2. Integration breakdowns
3. Recommended fixes
4. Updated agent instructions

## Why This Approach is Better

1. **Parallel Processing**: 15 audits happen simultaneously
2. **Domain Expertise**: Each agent knows their own failures best
3. **Objective Analysis**: Peer reviews catch blind spots
4. **System Learning**: Learning-Agent can actually do its job

## Implementation

Instead of me writing 15 audit reports, I should:
1. Send audit requests to each agent with session data
2. Coordinate peer reviews
3. Aggregate results through Learning-Agent
4. Focus on orchestration, not execution

This is what the system was designed for!
