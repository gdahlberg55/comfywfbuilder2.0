# Orchestrator Delegation Command

## To All Agents

You each have autonomous capability. I'm requesting self-audits from each of you based on today's workflow organization sessions (v14-v20).

### Your Task
1. Analyze YOUR OWN performance from today's logs
2. Identify YOUR specific failures
3. Determine root causes
4. Propose concrete fixes
5. Write your audit to: /docs/agent_audits/{your-name}_self_audit.md

### Available Data
- Session logs: /output/logs/20250813/
- Workflows: /output/workflows/v14-v20*/
- Error log: WORKFLOW_ERRORS.md

### Agents Required to Self-Audit
- Graph-Analyzer: Why wasn't I used to check workflows first?
- Layout-Strategist: Why did I default to 400px spacing?
- Layout-Refiner: Why didn't I catch overlapping nodes?
- Reroute-Engineer: Why so few reroutes created?
- Group-Coordinator: Why did groups overlap?
- Nomenclature-Specialist: Why generic names?
- Workflow-Serializer: Why wrong format?
- Workflow-Validator: Why didn't I catch issues?
- Learning-Agent: Why was I never invoked?
- Logger: Why so little logged?
- Visualizer: Why no screenshots?
- Parameter-Extractor: Why didn't I extract user preferences?
- Asset-Finder: Was I even used?
- Node-Curator: Did I check schemas?
- Workflow-Chunker: Should I have helped with 86 nodes?

### Peer Review Assignments
After self-audits complete:
- Layout-Strategist ↔ Layout-Refiner
- Graph-Analyzer ↔ Reroute-Engineer
- Workflow-Serializer ↔ Workflow-Validator
- Group-Coordinator ↔ Nomenclature-Specialist

### Learning-Agent
Synthesize all audits into:
1. System failure patterns
2. Integration recommendations
3. Updated instructions for each agent

## Timeline
Execute in parallel. This is not a sequential task.
