│   ├── debug/       # Debug logs by date
│   ├── errors/      # Error reports by date
│   └── reports/     # System reports
└── temp/tests/      # Test files
```

### 3. Naming Standards Established

#### Workflows
```
Pattern: {project}_{version}_{timestamp}_{stage}.json
Example: outfit_changer_v1_20250817_143022_final.json
