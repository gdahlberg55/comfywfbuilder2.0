# Anything Everywhere (AE) Workflow Architecture v2.0

## Overview
This architecture represents a revolutionary approach to ComfyUI workflow design using Anything Everywhere (AE) nodes to create a clean, professional data bus system that reduces visible connections by 73.5%.

## Architecture Highlights

### Data Bus System
The workflow implements 4 horizontal data bus lanes at the bottom of the canvas:
1. **MODEL_BUS (Y: 1200)** - Distributes the main model after LoRA stack processing
2. **CONDITIONING_BUS (Y: 1300)** - Carries positive and negative conditioning 
3. **RESOURCE_BUS (Y: 1400)** - Distributes CLIP and VAE resources
4. **DETECTOR_BUS (Y: 1500)** - Provides face, hand, and SAM detectors

### Connection Reduction
- **Original Connections**: 49 visible links
- **With AE Architecture**: 13 visible links
- **Reduction**: 73.5% fewer visible connections

### AE Node Placement Strategy

#### Foundation Layer (5 AE nodes)
- **AE_MODEL_MAIN**: Distributes final model from LoRA stack to 5 targets
- **AE_CLIP**: Distributes CLIP to 3 detail enhancement nodes
- **AE_VAE_MAIN**: Distributes VAE to 4 processing nodes
- **AE_POSITIVE**: Distributes positive conditioning to 5 nodes
- **AE_NEGATIVE**: Distributes negative conditioning to 5 nodes

#### Detection Layer (3 AE nodes)
- **AE_FACE_DETECTOR**: Connects face detector to both face passes
- **AE_HAND_DETECTOR**: Connects hand detector to both hand passes
- **AE_SAM_MODEL**: Distributes SAM model to 3 detail nodes

#### Upscaling Layer (1 AE node)
- **AE_UPSCALE_MODEL**: Shares RealESRGAN model between nodes

## Workflow Structure

### Stage 1: Foundation Setup (X: 50-850)
- Model loading chain (Checkpoint → Efficient Loader → LoRA Stack)
- Text encoding (Positive/Negative prompts)
- Latent image creation
- **5 AE nodes placed in data buses below**

### Stage 2: Initial Generation (X: 950-1350)
- Efficient KSampler with AE connections for all inputs
- Only visible connection: Latent input

### Stage 3: Detection Resources (X: 1350-1700)
- Face, Hand, and SAM model providers
- **3 AE nodes in detector bus**

### Stage 4-6: Detail Enhancement (X: 1750-4000)
- Face enhancement (2 passes)
- Hand enhancement (2 passes)
- Body detail enhancement
- All receive resources via AE nodes

### Stage 7: Multi-Stage Upscaling (X: 4050-4850)
- Multiple upscale models and processes
- **1 AE node for model distribution**

### Stage 8-9: Output & Video (X: 4850-6850)
- Preview and save operations
- Complete video generation pipeline

## Benefits of AE Architecture

1. **Visual Clarity**: Dramatically reduces line crossings and clutter
2. **Modular Design**: Easy to modify connections without rewiring
3. **Professional Appearance**: Clean data bus architecture
4. **Performance**: No impact on execution, only visual organization
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new nodes to existing buses

## Implementation Notes

- AE nodes are color-coded to match their data type
- All AE nodes placed in organized horizontal lanes
- Primary data flow remains visible for easy understanding
- Critical connections (image flow) kept as direct links
- Resource distribution handled entirely by AE system
