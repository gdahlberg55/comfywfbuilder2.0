        "connection_patterns": [],
        "parameter_settings": [],
        "layout_strategies": [],
        "optimization_techniques": []
    }
    
    # Analyze node combinations
    for node in workflow_json["nodes"]:
        # Extract unique combinations
        pass
    
    # Analyze connections
    for link in workflow_json["links"]:
        # Extract routing patterns
        pass
    
    return patterns
```
