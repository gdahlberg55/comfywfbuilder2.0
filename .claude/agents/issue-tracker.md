4. Track resolution progress
5. Maintain issue history and patterns

## Issue Categories

- **Workflow Management**: Version control, organization, validation
- **Agent Operations**: Agent failures, communication breakdowns
- **Performance**: Memory limits, processing delays, timeouts

## Issue Format
