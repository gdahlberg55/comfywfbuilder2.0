## ðŸŒŒ COSMIC & DIMENSIONAL PROMPTS

### 10. Stellar Craftsman
```
A cosmic blacksmith forging planets on an anvil made from a neutron star, hammer strikes creating supernovas, wearing an apron woven from the cosmic web, workshop floating in the void between galaxies, epic scale, cinematic lighting, detailed metalwork
```

### 11. Dimensional Tear
```
A torn piece of reality revealing multiple dimensions behind it like layers of wallpaper - one layer showing a medieval kingdom, another showing deep ocean, another showing alien civilization, hands from different dimensions reaching through, hyperrealistic, dramatic lighting
```

### 12. Consciousness Web
```
Neural pathways of a universal consciousness visualized as golden threads connecting floating islands of memories, each island a different biome representing emotions, synapses firing as aurora lights, third person view of a small figure navigating this mindscape
```

---

## ðŸŽ­ NARRATIVE & STORYTELLING PROMPTS

### 13. The Last Library
```
An infinite library where books are growing like plants, their pages turning into wings and flying away as paper birds, a librarian made of swirling ink and letters tending to story-trees, candlelight creating moving shadows that act out the tales, atmospheric, mysterious lighting
```

### 14. Time Merchant's Shop
```
An antique shop where each item is from a different time period but still functioning - a dinosaur egg incubator next to a holographic TV, cave paintings that move, a Victorian computer, Roman VR headset, cluttered composition, warm lighting, incredible detail
```

### 15. Dream Weaver's Loom
```
An ethereal figure weaving dreams on a cosmic loom, threads made of stardust and memories, the fabric showing sleeping people's dreams in moving tapestry form, surrounding workshop filled with bottled nightmares and crystallized hopes, fantasy art style, dramatic lighting
```

## ðŸš€ RECURSIVE PIPELINE PROMPTS

### Stage 1 â†’ Stage 2 Evolution
```
Initial: "A seed of light floating in darkness"
Evolution: "The seed cracks open revealing crystalline fractals growing in spiral patterns, each branch birthing smaller seeds of different colors"
```

### Stage 2 â†’ Stage 3 Enhancement
```
Previous: "Crystalline fractal growth"
Enhancement: "Each crystal face now contains a miniature ecosystem, microscopic civilizations visible within the refractions, bioluminescent details emerging"
```

### Stage 3 â†’ Stage 4 Mutation
```
Previous: "Crystal ecosystems"
Mutation: "The crystals begin melting into liquid dimensions, reality warping around them, time streams visible as golden rivers, parallel universes bleeding through"

## ðŸ’¡ PROMPT ENGINEERING TIPS FOR FLUX

### Structure for Best Results:
1. **Main Subject** - Clear, specific description
2. **Environment/Context** - Where and when
3. **Style Modifiers** - Artistic style, photography type
4. **Quality Boosters** - "hyperdetailed", "8K", "octane render"
5. **Lighting** - Specific lighting conditions
6. **Composition** - Camera angle, framing

### FLUX-Specific Strengths to Leverage:
- **Text in Images**: "neon sign reading 'FLUX'" 
- **Multiple Subjects**: Complex scenes with many elements
- **Accurate Hands/Faces**: Specify "perfect hands, detailed fingers"
- **Architecture**: Detailed buildings and structures
- **Reflections/Transparency**: Glass, water, mirrors
- **Particle Effects**: Dust, smoke, light beams

### Recursive Enhancement Words:
- First Pass: "emerging", "forming", "suggested"
- Second Pass: "developing", "crystallizing", "defining"
- Third Pass: "elaborate", "intricate", "complex"
- Fourth Pass: "transcendent", "evolved", "transformed"
- Final Pass: "perfected", "masterpiece", "ultimate"

## ðŸŽ¯ TESTING PROMPTS FOR WORKFLOW

### Quick Test (Simple):
```
"A glowing orb floating in space"
```

### Medium Complexity:
```
"Steampunk butterfly with clockwork wings landing on a flower made of brass and copper, morning dew on metal petals"
```

### High Complexity:
```
"A Renaissance painting coming alive where the painted figures are stepping out of their frames into a modern gallery, paint dripping from their clothes forming puddles of color on the white floor, shocked museum visitors taking photos, dramatic museum lighting, hyperrealistic mixed with painterly styles"
```

### Stress Test (Maximum Detail):
```
"An enormous tree whose trunk is a DNA double helix made of wood and light, branches spreading into different evolutionary paths - one branch has leaves becoming birds, another has fruits that are planets with tiny civilizations, roots visible underground connecting to mycelial network that lights up like neural pathways, each detail scientifically accurate yet fantastical, showing complete tree of life from bacteria to consciousness, recursive fractals in bark patterns, golden ratio composition, rendered in unprecedented detail where zooming in reveals infinite smaller ecosystems"
```

**Remember**: FLUX responds better to detailed, specific prompts rather than vague concepts. The more precise your description, the better FLUX can realize your vision!
